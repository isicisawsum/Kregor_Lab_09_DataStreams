In the United States, Tex-Mex can often get confused with authentic Mexican recipes. Thanks to its large Mexican population and close proximity to the country, food from the Southwestern region of the United States definitely has its roots in Mexican cooking.

However, Tex-Mex cuisine has evolved into its own category, and can be distinguished by heartier ingredients like cheese, beef, powdered spices and flour tortillas.

Whether you’re serving up a plate of sizzling fajitas or a pile of cheesy nachos, Tex-Mex is always welcome on the table.

Air Fryer Taquitos and Charred Salsa
Taquitos are the ultimate finger food—mini rolled tacos that are warm, cheesy and super crunchy! An air fryer makes this crowd-pleasing snack (or appetizer) surprisingly easy to cook up at home. We fill them with chunks of chicken and melty Colby Jack, but you can customize the ingredients to please even the pickiest of eaters with different proteins and cheeses. And while you have the air fryer fired up you can make a delicious charred salsa to serve alongside.
