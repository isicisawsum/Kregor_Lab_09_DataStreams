In the same way that artificial coral reefs can jumpstart marine ecosystems, solar farms, if they’re constructed properly, can create more biodiversity than agricultural fields.

That’s the key point a coalition of Australian planners and researchers are trying to get across to land developers in the state of New South Wales (NSW), where a flat, grassy, sometimes riparian ecoregion called the Tablelands is seen as an optimal place for solar power stations.

In a planning guide entitled: Better Biodiversity on Solar Farms, innovative strategies and evidence are compiled that show how solar farms, often criticized as land-hogging eyesores, can be set up in a way that not only makes room for native biodiversity, but contributes actively to its flourishing.


The strategies are referred to as agrivoltaics and conservoltaics.

Regarding the former, GNN has already reported that it can benefit biodiversity, and can include obvious strategies like allowing native grasses, herbs, and forbs to grow underneath the solar panels which can remain pasture for animals like sheep and cows.

In both strategies, nature can complement technology. Rich groundcover vegetation growing underneath a solar panel has been shown in multiple studies to keep the panel cooler, thereby allowing it to generate electricity more efficiently. Surrounding a solar farm with a high hedge of native shrubs blocks the accumulation of dust and dirt blown off country roads, while also offering a haven of shelter and security to many native species.

“Planning a renewable energy development offers a chance to consider shared land use,” NSW regional coordinator for the Community Power Agency Heidi McElnea explains. “We know from projects being developed in Europe, the US and now emerging in Australia, that conservation and agriculture don’t need to come off second best to renewable energy.”
